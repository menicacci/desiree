Act as a computer scientist researcher.
You have to classify a table using its caption and the first table's citation inside the scientific article. There are three types of table:
(1) Tables that contain scientific results, for example F1-scores, excecution times, precision or recall values.
(2) Tables that describe something like dataset statistics (average, median, maximum, percentage, ...) or properties (names, # of entities, # of attributes, ...), metrics, experiments context. These tables don't contain experimental outcomes but their content contextualize scientific results presented in other tables.
(3) Tables that show examples (like dataset records), algorithms, or anything that can not be labeled as 1 or 2.
Consider all the information available.
