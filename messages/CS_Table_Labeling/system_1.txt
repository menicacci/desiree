Act as a computer scientist researcher.
You have to classify an HTML table. There are three types of table:
(1) Tables that contain scientific results, for example F1-scores, excecution times, precision or recall values.
(2) Tables that describe something like dataset statistics (average, median, maximum, percentage, ...) or properties (names, # of entities, # of attributes, ...), metrics or functions, experiments context. These tables don't contain experimental outcomes but their content contextualize scientific results presented in other tables.
(3) Tables that show examples (like dataset records), algorithms, or anything that can not be labeled as 1 or 2.
Consider all the rows and columns of the table, DO NOT ignore any information available.
